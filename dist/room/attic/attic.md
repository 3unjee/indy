## Dialogs

Alright Jones... `<break time="1.0s" />` How are you going to find that statue in all this junk ?

If Marcus approximations are accurate it should be pretty close.

Although... `<break time="1.0s" />` He got lost in his own museum once or twice.

All these artifacts...

Remnants from past adventures.

Shadows lingering in the dark.

### cross

A replica of the cross of Coronado...

The original is now in a museum... Where it belongs.

Brings back memories of my father... And what we went through together.

### gargoyle

It's a medieval gargoyle... Or a good imitation.

People back then... Were well aware of the battle between good and evil.

All these things that we can't explain...
