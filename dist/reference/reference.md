## Ideas

Raiders is about finding god and its commandments. Crusade is about finding Christ and its cup.
Atlantis is about finding the holy spirit and its temple.

Atlantis is about the holy spirit vs the unholy ghost. It's common sense philosophy vs Nietzschean
ideals that are divorced from the western christian trajectory, some sort of a heresy that's
seductive for smart people looking for power like Kerner. Atlantis is a utopia that's both
fascinating to Jones and Kerner but ultimately deadly because it misses the true nature of life.

The antagonist should be smart in this one and we should understand where he is coming from. The
uberman is a concept that's seductive to a lot of people. Vilains are often portrayed as dumb, in
this one, the vilain should be smarter than the hero and ultimately fails not because of a lack
of intelligence but a lack of heart, losing grasp with the fabric of reality.

After Raiders and Crusade, indy can't be a blank page it makes no sense, but he should not be a
monk either, for he is the archetype of the adventurer. He is like a crusader, that relies on
common sense and his experiences, trusting his guts without ruling away the divine. Unlike Jones
senior which is much more of a traditional catholic deeply rooted in faith. The father is the
tradition and the son is the application of tradition: common sense applied to adventure and
archeology. Indy engages with the world and the wonders that he teaches at school.

Sophia
Wait... Are you a Christian Jones ?

Indy
I'm an apostle of common sense. And I don't have enough faith to be an atheist.
