## Ideas

Raiders is about finding god and its commandments. Crusade is about finding Christ and its cup.
Atlantis is about finding the holy spirit and its temple.

Atlantis is about the holy spirit vs the unholy ghost. It's common sense philosophy vs Nietzschean
ideals that are divorced from the western christian trajectory, some sort of a heresy that's
seductive for smart people looking for power like Kerner. Atlantis is a utopia that's both
fascinating to Jones and Kerner but ultimately deadly because it misses the true nature of life.

The antagonist should be smart in this one and we should understand where he is coming from. The
uberman is a concept that's seductive to a lot of people. Vilains are often portrayed as dumb, in
this one, the vilain should be smarter than the hero and ultimately fails not because of a lack
of intelligence but a lack of heart, losing grasp with the fabric of reality.

After Raiders and Crusade, indy can't be a blank page it makes no sense, but he should not be a
monk either, for he is the archetype of the adventurer. He is like a crusader, that relies on
common sense and his experiences, trusting his guts without ruling away the divine. Unlike Jones
senior which is much more of a traditional catholic deeply rooted in faith. The father is the
tradition and the son is the application of tradition: common sense applied to adventure and
archeology. Indy engages with the world and the wonders that he teaches at school.

### Kerner and the doctor

Kerner is the philosopher and the doctor is a rational mad scientist that has lost almost everyting
but reason. He is the archetype of the madman that's backed up by a corrupt ideology. He has little
room for redemption because his approach is entirely materialistic. Kerner has more of a romantic
trait along with finesse, he genuinely believes he is doing good. Kerner does not believe in good
or evil, he is a cold pragmatical scientific thinker that wants power to eradicate what he
considers unnatural. He is a nazy ideology zealot. His science is his god. Kerner sees nazism as a
mean to an end. The doctor sees nazism as the end.

### Prologue

Each Indiana Jones movie starts with a prologue from a previous adventure related to the film. It
could be interesting to set our prologue right before Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The idea
is to tie both stories deeply given the transformative experience that the third film consitute for
the main character and wasn't taken into account by subsequent Indiana Jones movie.

The idea would be having the short story about how Kerner steals the statue while starting a fire
in the Barnett College and taking Marcus into Custody. At the end Indiana decides to save Marcus
instead of retrieving the statue. That's how the prologue ends. It could have Kerner saying
something premonitory like "We'll see you in hell Doctor Jones" while contemplating the statue.

Later, coming back from the Last Crusade, the whole Atlantis story resurfaces as Marcus tells
Indiana that nazis are looking for Atlantis and Sophia Hapgood which dedicated her life to the lost
city after being part of the Jastro expedition with Indy back in the days. The important part
is that Indiana does not want to go to another adventure, considering nothing could ever top what
he went through with the Last Crusade. He eventually gets convinced by Marcus and possibly Henry
senior that the "crusade should not stop at the Holy Grail but extends all the way to the celestial
Jerusalem". Atlantis could represent that promised land or city while constantly being on the edge
between being a paradise on earth or hell. The artifact is not the end, it's a call to the above
and beyond.

The highlight should be on greek culture, artifcats, philosophy but enlightened by western
christinanity and Nietzschean counter philosophy. One could see this story as an extension of Last
Crusade given the "army of hell marching all over the earth" is still very much a possibility in
1939. The greek culture and myths should be the vessel for christian thematic that are interesting
for people of our age, inhabiting those archetypes with deep and strong reflection that go beyond
the renaissance up to our era, otherwise it would feel as a documentary which we want to avoid. The
question we raise should be actual and not something that's been settled or solved in the past. You
could see it as tradition, common sense and freedom against materialism, scientism and egocentrism.
Fate of Atlantis is an interesting story if it says something deep and opens reflection without
showing too much, as in being bound in the natural world until the very end, yet in a subtle and
brief manner.

As a result Henry senior motivation should be twofold:

1. Indiana Jones ought to stop nazism from reaching Atlantis secret power, completing the crusade.
"You are now a knight, do not settle home and finish the crusade". The idea of the Grail being the
starting point or the alpha point towards the spirit or the celestial city repesented by Atlantis.
Then again constantly battling against the evil spirit that ulitmately leads to hell. With the
grail he found the perfect artifact but he hasn't gone through hell yet. The Last Crusade is about
saving and ultimately reuniting father and son. The Fata of Atlantis is about goind through hell
towards the holy spirit, illumination and love.

2. The other motivation shall come from the heart, Indiana was close from Sophia when they left and
Herny senior advises him to find love and settle with a woman as the greatest adventure a man could
partake, ultimately leading to the extension of the Jones family beyond Henry senior, junior and
Marcus which is a bit like an adopted brother. The secret motivation ought to be love and bonding,
finding alterity with the right woman.

## Inspiration

Chesterton orthodoxy: for the adventurer archetype. Common sense driven, ready for adventure.
Willing to admit they are things that we don't understand beyond perception, based on perosnal
experiences on the field. It's more of a crusader faith than a monk.
