1
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,875
Alright Jones...

2
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,375
How are you going to 
to find that statue in all this junk.

3
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,500
If Marcus approximations are accurate 
it should be pretty close.

4
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,000
Although...

5
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,958
He got lost in his own museum once or twice.

6
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,958
A replica of the cross of Coronado.

7
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,833
The original is now in a museum...

8
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,166
...where it belongs.

9
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,416
Brings back memories of my father...

10
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,833
...and what we went through together.

11
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,291
It's a medieval gargoyle...

12
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,916
...or a good imitation.

13
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,250
People back then were well aware of 
the battle between good...

14
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:38,583
...and evil.

15
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,291
All these things that we can't explain.

16
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,083
All these artifacts...

17
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,083
Remnants from past adventures.
