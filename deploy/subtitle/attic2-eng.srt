1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,125
A replica of the cross of Coronado.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The original is now in a museum...

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,333
...where it belongs.

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,583
Brings back memories of my father...

5
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,000
...and what we went through together.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,500
It's a medieval gargoyle...

7
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,125
...or a good imitation.

8
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,458
People back then were well aware of 
the battle between good...

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,791
...and evil.

10
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,458
All these things that we can't explain.
