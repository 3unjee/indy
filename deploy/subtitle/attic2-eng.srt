1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,125
A replica of the cross of Coronado.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The original is now in a museum...

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,333
...where it belongs.

4
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,583
Brings back memories of my father...

5
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,000
...and what we went through together.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
It's a medieval gargoyle...

7
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,125
...or a good imitation.

8
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,458
People back then were well aware of 
the battle between good...

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,791
...and evil.

10
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,500
All these things that we can't explain.
